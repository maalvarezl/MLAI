## Module delivery plan

Details about the module delivery plan for COM4509/6509 are [here](./ModuleDeliveryPlanMLAIAutumn2021.pdf)

## Lab Sessions

We will use Jupyter Notebooks running a Python 3+ kernel for the Lab Sessions.

You can access the environment required in different ways.

### Option 1. 

The Desktop computers in The Diamond already have Anaconda installed. Download the notebooks and open them using the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/).

### Option 2.

You can [install Anaconda in your local computer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and then [launch Jupyter Notebook using the Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/). The Anaconda distribution contains all the Python libraries that we will use in this module (e.g. Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pytorch, etc).

If you are a Linux or MacOS user, you can open a Jupyter Notebook by moving to the `Labs` folder and then 
typing on your terminal

`jupyter notebook Lab 1 - Probability and Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks.ipynb`


### Option 3. 

The [University of Sheffield has a remote desktop service](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/remote/remote-desktop) that you can use. The remote desktops have Anaconda already installed. Once you connect to the remote desktop, use the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) to open a Jupyter Notebook. If you connect to a Linux computer, you can open Jupyter Notebook using the terminal as explained in Option 2.

### Option 4

You can run the Jupyter Notebooks directly on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index). Click on each Colab Badge to open the notebook.

If you want to save changes to the Notebook, you need to save them before quitting. According to [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Rmai0dD30XzL):

> If you would like to save your changes from within Colab, you can use the File menu to save the modified notebook either to Google Drive or back to GitHub. Choose File→Save a copy in Drive or File→Save a copy to GitHub and follow the resulting prompts. To save a Colab notebook to GitHub requires giving Colab permission to push the commit to your repository.
