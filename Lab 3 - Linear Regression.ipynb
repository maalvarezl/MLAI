    "Last week we considered a cost function for minimization of the error. We considered items (films) and users and assumed that each movie rating, $y_{i,j}$ could be summarised by an inner product between a vector associated with the item, $\\mathbf{v}_j$ and one associated with the user $\n",
    "\\mathbf{u}_i$. We justified the inner product as a measure of similarity in the space of 'movie subjects', where both the users and the items lived, giving the analogy of a library.\n",

    "This is known as a sum of squares error. Minimizing it was first proposed by [Legendre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre) in 1805. His book, which was on the orbit of comets, is available on google books, we can take a look at the relevant page by calling the code below. "

A [QR-decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) of a matrix factorises it into a matrix which is an orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, so that $\\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{I}$. And a matrix which is upper triangular, $\\mathbf{R}$. \n",
