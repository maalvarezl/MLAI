    "# Basis Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20th October 2015 Neil Lawrence\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now seen how we may perform linear regression. Now, we are going to consider how we can perform *non-linear* regression. However, before we get into the details of how to do that we first need to consider in what ways the regression can be non-linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate linear regression allows us to build models that take many features into account when making our prediction. In this session we are going to introduce *basis functions*. The term seems complicated, but they are actually based on rather a simple idea. If we are doing a multivariate linear regression, we get extra features that *might* help us predict our required response variable (or target value), $y$. But what if we only have one input value? We can actually artificially generate more input values with basis functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-linear in the Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "When we refer to non-linear regression, we are normally referring to whether the regression is non-linear in the input space, or non-linear in the *covariates*. The covariates are the observations that move with the target (or *response*) variable. In our notation we have been using $\\mathbf{x}_i$ to represent a vector of the covariates associated with the $i$th observation. The coresponding response variable is $y_i$. If a model is non-linear in the inputs, it means that there is a non-linear function between the inputs and the response variable. Linear functions are functions that only involve multiplication and addition, in other words they can be represented through *linear algebra*. Linear regression involves assuming that a function takes the form\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{w}$ are our regression weights. A very easy way to make the linear regression non-linear is to introduce non-linear functions. When we are introducing non-linear regression these functions are known as *basis functions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basis Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the idea, instead of working directly on the original input space, $\\mathbf{x}$, we build models in a new space, $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x})$ where $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(\\cdot)$ is a *vector valued* function that is defined on the space $\\mathbf{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, that a vector valued function is just a vector that contains functions instead of values. Here's an example for a one dimensional input space, $x$, being projected to a *quadratic* basis. First we consider each basis function in turn, we can think of the elements of our vector as being indexed so that we have\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\phi_1(x) = 1, \\\\\n",
    "\\phi_2(x) = x, \\\\\n",
    "\\phi_3(x) = x^2.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Now we can consider them together by placing them in a vector,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(x) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ x \\\\ x^2\\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is the idea of the vector valued function, we have simply collected the different functions together in the same vector making them notationally easier to deal with in our mathematics. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider the vector valued function for each data point, then we place all the data into a matrix. The result is a matrix valued function,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\mathbf{x}) = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & x_1^2 \\\\\n",
    "1 & x_2 & x_2^2\\\\\n",
    "\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n",
    "1 & x_n & x_n^2\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where we are still in the one dimensional input setting so $\\mathbf{x}$ here represents a vector of our inputs with $n$ elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try constructing such a matrix for a set of inputs. First of all, we create a function that returns the matrix valued function"
