    "\n",
    "In 1933 [Harold Hotelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hotelling) published on *principal component analysis* the first mention of this approach. Hotelling's inspiration was to provide mathematical foundation for factor analysis methods that were by then widely used within psychology and the social sciences. His model was a factor analysis model, but he considered the noiseless 'limit' of the model. In other words he took $\\sigma^2_i \\rightarrow 0$ so that he had\n",

    "\\mathbf{y}_{i, :} \\sim \\lim_{\\sigma^2 \\rightarrow 0} \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top + \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The paper had two unfortunate effects. Firstly, the resulting model is no longer valid probablistically, because the covariance of this Gaussian is 'degenerate'. Because $\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top$ has rank of at most $q$ where $q<p$ (due to the dimensionality reduction) the determinant of the covariance is zero, meaning the inverse doesn't exist so the density,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathbf{y}_{i, :}|\\mathbf{W}) = \\lim_{\\sigma^2 \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{p}{2} |\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top + \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}|^{-1}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{y}_{i, :}\\left[\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top+ \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}\\right]^{-1}\\mathbf{y}_{i, :}\\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "is *not* valid for $q<p$ (where $\\mathbf{W}\\in \\Re^{p\\times q}$). This mathematical consequence is a probability density which has no 'support' in large regions of the space for $\\mathbf{y}_{i, :}$. There are regions for which the probability of $\\mathbf{y}_{i, :}$ is zero. These are any regions that lie off the hyperplane defined by mapping from $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\mathbf{y}$ with the matrix $\\mathbf{W}$. In factor analysis the noise corruption, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, allows for points to be found away from the hyperplane. In Hotelling's PCA the noise variance is zero, so there is only support for points that fall precisely on the hyperplane. Secondly, Hotelling explicity chose to rename factor analysis as principal component analysis, arguing that the factors social scientist sought were different in nature to the concept of a mathematical factor. This was unfortunate because the factor loadings, $\\mathbf{W}$ can also be seen as factors in the mathematical sense because the model Hotelling defined is a Gaussian model with covariance given by $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{W}^\\top$ so $\\mathbf{W}$ is a *factor* of the covariance in the mathematical sense, as well as a factor loading. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the paper had one great advantage over standard approaches to factor analysis. Despite the fact that the model was a special case that is subsumed by the more general approach of factor analysis it is this special case that leads to a particular algorithm, namely that the factor loadings (or principal components as Hotelling referred to them) are given by an [eigendecomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix) of the empirical covariance matrix. \n"

    "## Why\n",
    "\n",
    "[Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) is a fundamental problem in machine learning where we aim to learn from unlabelled data. Unsupervised feature learning or representation learning can find wide usage in various applications for extracting useful information from often abundant unlabelled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B1. Autograd: Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, we briefly covered **Tensor** and **Computational Graph**. We have actually used **Autograd** already. Here, we learn the basics below, a condensed and modified version of the original [PyTorch tutorial on Autograd](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-autograd-tutorial-py)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why differentiation is important? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because it is a key procedure in **optimisation** to find the optimial solution of a loss function. The process of learning/training aims to minimise a predefined loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How automatic differentiation is done in pytorch?\n",
    "The PyTorch ``autograd`` package makes differentiation (almost) transparent to you by providing automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors, unless you donot want it (to save time and space). \n",
    "\n",
    "A ``torch.Tensor`` type variable has an attribute ``.requires_grad``. Setting this attribute ``True`` tracks (but not computes yet) all operations on it. After we define the forward pass, and hence the *computational graph*, we call ``.backward()`` and all the gradients will be computed automatically and accumulated into the ``.grad`` attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is made possible by the [**chain rule of differentiation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to stop automatic differentiation (e.g., because it is not needed)\n",
    "Calling method ``.detach()`` of a tensor will detach it from the computation history. We can also wrap the code block in ``with torch.no_grad():`` so all tensors in the block do not track the gradients, e.g., in the test/evaluation stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Function\n",
    "\n",
    "``Tensor``s are connected by ``Function`` to build an acyclic *computational graph* to encode a complete history of computation. The ``.grad_fn`` attribute of a tensor references a ``Function`` created\n",
    "the ``Tensor``, i.e., this ``Tensor`` is the output of its ``.grad_fn`` in the computational graph.\n",
