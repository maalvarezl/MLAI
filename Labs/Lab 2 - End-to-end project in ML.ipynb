We could code such function from scratch, but here, we make use of the [ColumnTransformer()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html?highlight=columntransformer#sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer), an estimator available in scikit-learn that allows to group different transformations into a single method. `ColumnTransformer` is an example of an *estimator* in scikit-learn. An estimator is an object that provides predictions for new data. Besides the `fit`, `transform` and `fir_transform` methods, they most of the times provide the additional `predict` method for making predictions on the test data. \n",
