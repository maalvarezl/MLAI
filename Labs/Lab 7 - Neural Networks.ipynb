    "## Why\n",
    "\n",
    "The fast rising of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) starts on 30 September 2012, when a convolutional neural network (CNN) called [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) achieved a top-5 error of 15.3% in the ImageNet 2012 Challenge, more than **10.8 percentage** points lower than that of the runner up. This is considered a breakthrough and has grabbed the attention of increasing number of researchers, practioners, and the general public. Since then, deep learning has penetrated to many research and application areas. AlexNet contained **eight layers**. In 2015, it was outperformed by a very deep CNN with **over 100 layers** from Microsoft in the ImageNet 2015 contest. It will be interesting to take a look at the image classification task and a CNN that can do the job well."

    "## 1. Review of Autograd: Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, we briefly covered **Tensor** and **Computational Graph**. We have actually used **Autograd** already. Here, we learn the basics below, a condensed and modified version of the original [PyTorch tutorial on Autograd](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-autograd-tutorial-py)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why differentiation is important? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because it is a key procedure in **optimisation** to find the optimial solution of a loss function. The process of learning/training aims to minimise a predefined loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How automatic differentiation is done in PyTorch?\n",
    "The PyTorch ``autograd`` package makes differentiation (almost) transparent to you by providing automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors, unless you do not want it (to save time and space). \n",
    "\n",
    "A ``torch.Tensor`` type variable has an attribute ``.requires_grad``. Setting this attribute ``True`` tracks (but not computes yet) all operations on it. After we define the forward pass, and hence the *computational graph*, we call ``.backward()`` and all the gradients will be computed automatically and accumulated into the ``.grad`` attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is made possible by the [**chain rule of differentiation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to stop automatic differentiation (e.g., because it is not needed)\n",
    "Calling method ``.detach()`` of a tensor will detach it from the computation history. We can also wrap the code block in ``with torch.no_grad():`` so all tensors in the block do not track the gradients, e.g., in the test/evaluation stage. "
